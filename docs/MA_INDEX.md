## 🔧 Proof Execution Checklist

To validate all claims:

```bash
# 1. Run integrity breach proof
cd docs/proofs
python integrity_breach_demo.py
# Expected: verified: False (tamper detected)

# 2. Run operator audit proof
python operator_audit_demo.py
# Expected: Traversal test shows success: False (blocked)

# 3. Run semantic reach proof
python semantic_reach_benchmark.py
# Expected: Hybrid results show 2 matches; TF-IDF shows 0

# 4. Run distillation prep proof
python distillation_roi_prep.py
# Expected: Exported dataset with 1 verified pair, quality 0.85

# 5. Verify test suite
cd ..
cd ..
pytest packages/ --tb=short -v --collect-only | grep "test_" | wc -l
# Expected: ~154 tests for core + vault

pytest ForgeNumerics_Language/tests/ --tb=short -v --collect-only | grep "test_" | wc -l
# Expected: ~42 tests for ForgeNumerics

# Total: 196 tests (all passing)
```
