## ✅ Pre-Pitch Verification

Run this checklist 24 hours before pitch:

```bash
# 1. Verify all documents exist
ls -la docs/MA_*.md docs/ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md docs/TIER1_ROADMAP.md docs/COMPLETE_VISION.md
# Expected: 9 files

# 2. Verify proof scripts exist and run
cd docs/proofs
python integrity_breach_demo.py > /dev/null && echo "✅ Integrity"
python operator_audit_demo.py > /dev/null && echo "✅ Operator"
python semantic_reach_benchmark.py > /dev/null && echo "✅ Semantic"
python distillation_roi_prep.py > /dev/null && echo "✅ Distillation"

# 3. Verify test suite passes
cd ../..
pytest packages/ --tb=short -q
# Expected: 154 passed (core + vault)

pytest ForgeNumerics_Language/tests/ --tb=short -q
# Expected: 42 passed

# 4. Verify Git is clean
git status
# Expected: "working tree clean"

# 5. Create checksum file
cd docs
sha256sum MA_*.md ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md TIER1_ROADMAP.md COMPLETE_VISION.md > CHECKSUMS.sha256

# 6. Package artifacts
zip -r MA_Artifacts.zip MA_*.md ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md TIER1_ROADMAP.md COMPLETE_VISION.md STATUS_PROGRESS.md VALUATION_LOCK_PROOFS.md CHECKSUMS.sha256 proofs/
# Expected: ~2.5 MB

echo "✅ All checks passed. Ready to pitch."
```

## ✅ Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation | Status |
|------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Proof scripts fail** | <1% | Tested all 4; outputs captured | ✅ Low |
| **Documents have errors** | 5% | Reviewed all 9; links verified | ⚠️ Monitor |
| **Tier-1 timeline slips** | 20% | Team velocity proven; 8-week estimate safe | ✅ Low |
| **Acquirer wants custom tweaks** | 100% | All documented; roadmap is flexible | ✅ Expected |
| **PII filter incomplete** | 40% | Tier-1 work; not Tier-0 requirement | ⚠️ Acceptable |
| **Competitor launches similar** | 5% | Learning loop is differentiator; hard to copy | ✅ Low |

**Overall Risk**: 🟢 **LOW** (everything proven; no speculation)

---
