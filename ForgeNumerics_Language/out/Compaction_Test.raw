North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.

impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.
North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.

that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,

sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.

smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle

The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.

beauty is a luxury in a place

cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.

She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water

wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.

that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,

She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,

The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.

at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark

and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.

about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.

Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.North of the maps and the weather man’s chatter,
past where the radio frets about storms,
there is only a silence so wide
that even the sky has to whisper.

Here, snow is not just snow.
It is language:
fresh hush on top of yesterday’s story,
old drifts holding secrets of winters
that never learned to melt.

A polar bear moves through it
like a slow, deliberate thought.
Shoulders roll under fur
thick as remembered love,
paws broad as dinner plates,
each step an enormous mark
pressed into the white page of the world.

Her breath is a small cloud
that refuses to join the sky.
Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.

Tiny stars of frost cling to her whiskers;
her black nose tastes the wind
for rumors of seal, of open leads,
of anything warm enough to be called alive.

She is not cruel.
She is hunger in a kingdom of ice,
a mother with two cubs tumbling behind her
like dropped snowballs that learned to walk.
They bite each other’s ears,
slide on their bellies down small slopes,
then scramble back, chirping complaints
only she understands.

Far away, where the world
tilts another way into winter,
penguins gather on a ledge of blue.
They are a spill of tuxedos
at the edge of a frozen ballroom floor,
smoothing their feathers,
arguing in sharp, silver voices
about who will jump first.

One leans over
and sees his own face in the sea,
distorted by ripples and faint green light.
The water smells of salt and far places,
of krill and the long highways of whales.
He shivers, not from cold,
but from the cliff-edge thrill of being small
at the lip of something endless.

Then—
a single bold body
cuts the air like a comma,
puncturing the calm.
Others follow:
splash, slash, scatter,
the flock un-writing itself into water,
black and white turning to swift streaks
that chase their shadows through the green.

Beneath their dance,
seals sleep on the ocean’s slow breath.
One surfaces in a gap in the ice,
nose first, like a question.
Her eyes are polished coal,
wide with the logic of survival.
She knows the bear above her
the way a poem knows silence:
by the edges where it might end.

On a lonely floe
another seal lies like a comma
between two sentences of snow.
Her fur is the color of old moonlight,
her whiskers twitching
at every distant crunch, every whisper
of paw or claw or wing.

Snow keeps falling,
not in a hurry,
just endlessly committed to its role.
It powders the bear’s back,
fills the penguins’ footprints,
softens the scars on old ice
where seasons have argued for years.

Sometimes it falls sideways,
pushed by a wind with too many ideas.
Sometimes it floats straight down,
as if each flake has made up its mind.
Under starlight it glows faintly,
a billion frost-bitten fireflies
that forgot how to burn
but still remember how to shine.

Night gathers early here.
The horizon folds itself
into a tight, dark line,
and the aurora unpacks its green silk
and hangs it on the hooks of the stars.
The animals look up only briefly;
beauty is a luxury in a place
where hunger counts the hours.

The polar bear pauses on a ridge,
cubs pressing against her legs.
She smells penguin somewhere
impossibly far,
seals somewhere closer,
and a faint trace of human metal
on the wind.

She does not know
about maps or melting graphs,
about voices arguing in warm rooms
over lines and numbers and futures.
She only knows the ice is different,
its language slightly broken:
sea-ice sentences ending
with too many question marks,
periods turning to dots of water
where they shouldn’t be.

A penguin stands on his rookery
and peers at the thinning ledge.
He does not know the word “climate”,
but he knows that last year
the snow stayed longer on his feet,
that this season the air feels looser,
as if the sky has been unbuttoned.

Still, life insists.

The bear lowers her head
to nuzzle a cub back onto its paws.
The penguins huddle closer,
sharing the arithmetic of warmth.
The seals slip through black water
like commas and apostrophes
in a story still being written.

And snow, stubborn,
keeps trying to explain itself,
flake by fragile flake,
falling over and over
on fur, on feather, on whisker,
on the bright, wet eyes of the living,

whispering:
remember this,
remember us,
remember that once
there was a world
where cold could be beautiful,
where white did not mean empty,
and where every small heartbeat
in the frozen dark
was a candle
the night could never quite blow out.
