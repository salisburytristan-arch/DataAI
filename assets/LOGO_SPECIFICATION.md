# Logo Specification: The "Logic Trinity"

## 1. The Geometry (The Icon)

**Shape:** An equilateral triangle pointing upwards (the ancient symbol for "Fire" or "Upward Momentum"), but deconstructed into three nodes.

- **Node A (Bottom Left)**: Represents State 0 (False/Ground)
  - Symbol: ⊙ (Circle with a center dot)

- **Node B (Bottom Right)**: Represents State 1 (True/Power)
  - Symbol: ⊗ (Circle with an "X" or cross)

- **Node C (Top Apex)**: Represents State 2 (Paradox/Unknown)
  - Symbol: Φ (Circle with a vertical stroke - the "Phi" state)

**The Circuitry:** Thin, sharp schematic lines connect the three nodes to a central, invisible point, implying that the combination of 0, 1, 2 creates the "Intelligence" in the center.

## 2. The Typography

- **Font:** Monospaced, OCR-style (like Courier Prime or OCRB)
- **Kerning:** Wide tracking (letters spaced apart)
- **Styling:**
  - FORGE (Bold, Heavy weight)
  - NUMERICS (Light, Thin weight)

## 3. The Palette (Terminal Phosphor)

- **Background:** `#050505` (Void Black - darker than standard black)
- **Primary Foreground:** `#00FF41` (Matrix Green) or `#39FF14` (Neon Green)
- **Accent (The Phi Symbol):** `#FFFFFF` (Pure White) – to highlight the "3rd State" as the unique differentiator

## Brand Strategy

### Why This Works for Valuation:

1. **Defensibility:** The logo literally depicts the proprietary trinary states (⊙, ⊗, Φ) defined in the IP. It proves this isn't just binary logic.

2. **Product Definition:** It looks like a "System Architecture" diagram, reinforcing that this is a technical substrate, not a consumer toy.

3. **Brand Moat:** It creates a "Secret Society" vibe. Developers who see the Φ at the top will understand that this system handles uncertainty/paradox differently than standard boolean logic.
